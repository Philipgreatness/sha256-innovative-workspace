# SHA256 Innovative Workspace: Health Data Access Control

A blockchain-powered platform for secure, privacy-preserving health data management and controlled sharing.

## Overview

The SHA256 Innovative Workspace provides a cutting-edge solution for managing health data access with unprecedented granularity, security, and user control. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a transparent, auditable system where individuals maintain complete sovereignty over their sensitive health information.

### Key Innovations

- üîí Fine-grained access control
- üè• Verified healthcare data sharing
- üïµÔ∏è Comprehensive privacy preservation
- üìä Transparent, immutable audit trails

## Core Principles

1. **User Sovereignty**: Complete control over personal health data
2. **Selective Disclosure**: Grant or revoke access to specific health domains
3. **Compliance-Ready**: Designed with privacy regulations in mind
4. **Secure by Design**: No raw health data stored on-chain

## Supported Health Data Domains

- Cardiac Metrics
- Metabolic Indicators
- Sleep Analysis
- Activity Tracking
- Glucose Levels
- Oxygen Saturation
- Body Temperature
- Weight Metrics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks Wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain interactions

### Quick Setup

1. **Register Identity**
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-access-control register-identity)
```

2. **Register Health Endpoint**
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-access-control register-endpoint "device-uuid" "smartwatch")
```

3. **Grant Access to Healthcare Provider**
```clarity
(contract-call? .health-access-control grant-domain-access 
    'SP_HEALTHCARE_PROVIDER 
    "cardiac-metrics" 
    (some u100000))
```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Identity Management
- Secure user registration
- Endpoint (device) tracking
- Verified consumer authentication

### Access Control Mechanism
- Domain-specific permissions
- Granular access granting
- Time-bound access tokens
- Immediate revocation capabilities

### Audit System
- Comprehensive access logging
- Immutable event tracking
- Transparent permission history

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Zero on-chain health data storage
- **Minimal Exposure**: Only access metadata tracked
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Blockchain-guaranteed non-repudiation
- **Flexible Permissions**: Precise, revocable access controls

## Development

### Testing
```bash
clarinet test
```

### Local Deployment
```bash
clarinet console
```
